Connect Rx of ESP12 -> Tx of Arduino.

Connect Tx of ESP12 -> Rx of Arduino.

There is one analog pin available in NodeMCU (ESP12), we could use that pin but ESP series can 
take upto 3.3 volts on their pins. As we are using current sensor which can give upto 5 Volts 
so, it can damage our Wi-Fi module thatâ€™s why we are not using standalone NodeMCU. To make output 
of current sensor 3.3V instead of 5V, we cannot use voltage divider circuit between Current sensor 
and analog pin of NodeMCU because as we discussed above about the current sensor that at 2.5Volts 
output, current is 0Amp. So, Arduino will read the current sensor value through analog pin and 
send it to the Wi-Fi module ESP12 using Serial communication. Use voltage divider circuit at re-
-ceiver pin of NodeMCU so that receiver pin can get upto 3.3 Voltage level.
To monitor our energy uses over the internet, we have to use MQTT broker. We will use MQTT broker 
as AdaFruit IO platform and follow the below process to make this IoT Energy Meter
1. Setting up an AdaFruit account for storing Electricity meter readings.
2. Create Applet in IFTTT for Triggering SMS/Email for Energy Meter
3. Codes for Arduino and ESP12 Wi-Fi module.
